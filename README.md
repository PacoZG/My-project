|  08.03  |  20    | Contruction of the idea, preliminary backend and basic frontend implementation with      |
|         |        | express and redux                                                                        |
|  15.03  |  30    | Further implementation of the backend for users connecting with mongodb and deep dive    |
|         |        | into learning about tailwindcss using documentation and videos                           |
|  22.03  |  5     | Continued implementation but nothing very significant since I had to do an almost two    |
|         |        | week break due to corona infection                                                       |
|  05.04  |  15    | Significant changes on the implementation, adding signIn and signUp forms, styling with  |
|         |        | tailwindcss using at that moment some example components as part of the learning process |
|  12.04  |  16    | Three days of work with the addition of few frontend components, addition of more        |
|         |        | components such as Footer, Modal better understanding of the communication between       |
|         |        | back and frontend and some code refactoring                                              |
|  19.04  |  25    | Keeping the implementation of back and frontend with also a deeper study and             |
|         |        | understanding of Redux react, further implementation of mongo models for alerts and      |
|         |        | further understanding of how to the backend communicates errors or confirmation          |
|         |        | with the frontend. Also learning and implementation of upload and removal of images      |
|         |        | from Cloudinary using multer setting the middlewares, the reducer and the necessary      |
|         |        | decoding files and lots of refactoring                                                   |
|  26.04  |  15    | Further implemtation of back and frontend, addition of components and reimplementing     |
|         |        | the use of notification to Modal alerts through reducers and mainly code refactoring     |
|  03.05  |  46    | Implmentation of app in finnish and Spanish using reducer to set the UI language,        |
|         |        | test implementation through jest and cypress for e2e testing, further tailwind           |
|         |        | refactoring for all the components in every language, lots of js code refactoring,       |
|         |        | implementation of pipeline through github and heroku and README file including the       |
|         |        | project report.                                                                          |
|  10.05  |  21    | Following professor suggestions I did a lot of refactor, internazionalized the code using|
|         |        | i18next (which took me around 14 hours to get it installed and working) so I could get   |
|         |        | rid of the repeatitive .js files for the old language navigation, cleaning code from all |
|         |        | the useless comments, removing all the else statements and use of the guard claus instead|
|         |        | and last but not least installing and configuring Prettier which needed some configuring |
|         |        | to resolve conflicts with Eslint                                                         |
|  17.05  |  48    | This week I was able to setup the logic in the back and front end for blog posts using   |
|         |        | react-markdown and stylising with prose tools from tailwind css, one page to see the list|
|         |        | of blogs, one for the rendering of an specific blog and another for the creation of it   |
|         |        | with the tools that allows the creator to see how it will look in real time.             |
|         |        | Also I was able to buy the domains, configure the DNS on the respective DNS provider and |
|         |        | with the domain provider, and also setting up the domains on Heroku.                     |
|         |        | I was also able to add the cookies banner on it's own component file along with the      |
|         |        | cookies policy. And finally better funtionality in the user menu with smoother           |
|         |        | transitions.                                                                             |
|  24.05  |  47    | This week I added a Forum call Jane's Salon and manage to finish the logic to create     |
|         |        | discussion, make comment and reply to the comments, this with the registriction of a     |
|         |        | registered user, meaning that anyone can make comments or reply to the comments but only |
|         |        | registered user can edit or delete their own comments or replies and the admins can      |
|         |        | do anything to avoid spam or bad conduct in the forum. I spend many hours looking for an |
|         |        | afficient way to optimize images so they don't use a lot of space in the cloud and do not|
|         |        | take too long to download to the but I couldn't,find one that wouldn't present amongs    |
|         |        | other pages to promote services. issues. Fixed many bugs, added the share page website   |
|         |        | and personal fb page in facebook.  I want to add an special page for the trainer to can  |
|         |        | create a exercise program only with dropdown menus, but for that I need the trainer's    |
|         |        | help so it will be done in the future amongs other pages to promote services.            |
|  31.05  |   7    | On Monday I added all the missing translations for the new pages, fixed few minor bugs on|
|         |        | some of the components and finally added the code of conduct page for the forum          |
|  Total  |  295   |                                                                                          |
